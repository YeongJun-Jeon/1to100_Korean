feat: Integrate full pipeline into main.py and refine image cropping

Integrates PDF conversion, YOLOv8 inference, annotation processing,
image cropping, and PDF recombination into a single main.py script.

Key improvements and fixes:
- Refactored src/config.py to use a Config class for centralized settings, including new margin properties and a LABELING_DPI for accurate scaling.
- Updated src/annotation_processor.py to correctly scale and round bounding box coordinates based on Config.SCALE_FACTOR, resolving "black areas" and "flying parts" in cropped images.
- Implemented 2-column layout sorting in src/annotation_processor.py based on X and Y coordinates to maintain logical reading order.
- Modified src/pdf_processor.py to use DPI from Config for consistent image generation, and adjusted its execution within main.py.
- Integrated YOLOv8 inference logic directly into main.py, including a confidence threshold of 0.3 to reduce false positives.
- Fixed various import and attribute errors across modules due to refactoring and integration.

Image cropping and YOLOv8 inference are now confirmed to be working perfectly.
Further work is needed on logical unit grouping and shuffling.
